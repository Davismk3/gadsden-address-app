# Web Application For Gadsden County EMS

I work on an ambulance as an EMT. A common issue is misshearing 
dispatch when they read off the address for a given call, which 
increases our response time. This web application uses Metaphone and Rapidfuzz 
to best match a missheard road name to actual roads in Gadsden County.
Though simple, this has helped me and my partners on real EMS calls.
